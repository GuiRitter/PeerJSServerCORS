# PeerJS Server with CORS

I'm hosting a [PeerJS Server](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) instance to use in a project, and I've had to setup CORS so I can call it from any origin.

I wanted to setup CORS so I could debug the client at `localhost` but I failed to do that. I ended up publishing the client. It worked with PeerJS Server running in the command line, so I no longer need this custom server.
